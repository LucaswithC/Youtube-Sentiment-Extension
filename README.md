# Youtube Sentiment Analyzer

The style in which people write their comments can tell you a lot about how a video was perceived and what the general opinion of the content was.

This extension analyzes the sentiment of Youtube comments to give you a good overview of the feelings of the community.

This can serve as a good alternative to likes and dislikes, now that dislikes are no longer visible.
